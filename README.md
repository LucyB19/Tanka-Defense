# Tanka-Defense
A mobile chat app that when emergency mode is activated will send your location to all of your contacts, along with an emergency message
Emergency mode can be activated by pressing on the dog in the middle of the home screen, and unactivated by pressing the "unassuming button" underneath it. To access the app on an iPhone, you first need to install the expo app, which I used to develop the Tanka Defense app. When you pull up the app, you can immediately sign in. If there is no user in the database already, it will create a new user.
